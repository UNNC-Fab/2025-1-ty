Hi, I am **Yishan TONG**.

I am currently pursuing the MRes in *Innovative Product Design and Manufacture* at the [University of Nottingham Ningbo China](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx), under the Faculty of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering.

My research focuses on human-centered design solutions to alleviate cognitive load, particularly investigating how wearable devices can enhance pedestrian safety and psychological comfort in mixed traffic scenarios.
