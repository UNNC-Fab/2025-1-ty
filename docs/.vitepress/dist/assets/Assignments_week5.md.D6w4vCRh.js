A Complete Guide to Its Technology and Applications</a></p><p>CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control, which is a method of controlling mechanical movement and the machining process using digital information. CNC technology combines multiple disciplines such as computer technology, automation control technology, drive technology, and precision measurement technology, and is widely used in the manufacturing industry.</p><p>In a CNC system, operators write specific program codes to input information about the shape, dimensions, and process parameters of the part to be machined into the computer control system. Based on these instructions, the control system precisely controls the moving parts of the machine tool, such as the movement path of the cutting tool, the spindle speed, and the feed rate, to achieve automated machining of the workpiece.</p><p>Compared with traditional manual machining methods, CNC machining has many significant advantages. It can achieve a high degree of precision and repeatability, ensuring that each machined part meets strict design requirements and greatly improving the stability of product quality. At the same time, CNC machining is highly efficient, capable of quickly completing complex machining tasks, reducing the production cycle, and increasing production efficiency. Additionally, by modifying the program code, different parts can be easily machined, offering strong flexibility and adaptability.</p><h2 id="practical-exercise" tabindex="-1">Practical Exercise <a class="header-anchor" href="#practical-exercise" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practical Exercise&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This practical exercise will use the MDX - 50 benchtop CNC from Roland DGA products to machine the XIAO ESP32C3 board designed and exported in Fusion 360.
