We learned that it&#39;s an additive manufacturing process, building 3D objects layer - by - layer from digital models, distinct from traditional methods with more design flexibility and less waste.​ For practicals, we started with 3D scanning. After setting up the scanner and positioning the object, we collected data from various angles to create a detailed 3D model, which was refined in software. Then, we used the Makerworld website&#39;s vase generator, customized the design, downloaded the model, and imported it into Bambustudio. We adjusted the model&#39;s position, scale, and printing settings like speed, temperature, and layer height before printing. This week provided us with a good mix of theory and practice on 3D printing.</p><h2 id="what-is-3d-printing" tabindex="-1">What is 3D printing? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-3d-printing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is 3D printing?&quot;">​</a></h2><p><img src="https://unncfab.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/img/tong/20250417103552130.png" alt=""><a href="https://www.hubs.com/guides/3d-printing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3D printing</a>, also known as additive manufacturing, is a technology that constructs objects layer by layer using powdered metals, plastics, or other bondable materials based on digital model files. Different from traditional subtractive manufacturing (such as cutting and machining), 3D printing creates objects from scratch. According to the designed 3D model, materials are gradually stacked to form a solid, which can greatly reduce material waste and can produce complex structures that are difficult to achieve with traditional processes. <img src="https://unncfab.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/img/tong/20250417085227160.png" alt=""><img src="https://unncfab.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/img/tong/20250417103324661.png" alt=""></p><h2 id="practice-exercises" tabindex="-1">Practice Exercises <a class="header-anchor" href="#practice-exercises" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practice Exercises&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="_3d-scanning" tabindex="-1">3D Scanning <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3d-scanning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3D Scanning&quot;">​</a></h3><ol><li>Prepare the 3D scanner and ensure that the device is calibrated and has sufficient power.</li><li>Place the object to be scanned on a stable surface, ensuring uniform lighting around and no obvious reflections.</li><li>Start the 3D scanner.
