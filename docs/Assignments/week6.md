# week 6: 3D printing
In this week, we explored 3D printing in depth. We learned that it's an additive manufacturing process, building 3D objects layer - by - layer from digital models, distinct from traditional methods with more design flexibility and less waste.â€‹
For practicals, we started with 3D scanning. After setting up the scanner and positioning the object, we collected data from various angles to create a detailed 3D model, which was refined in software. Then, we used the Makerworld website's vase generator, customized the design, downloaded the model, and imported it into Bambustudio. We adjusted the model's position, scale, and printing settings like speed, temperature, and layer height before printing. This week provided us with a good mix of theory and practice on 3D printing.
## What is 3D printing?

[3D printing](https://www.hubs.com/guides/3d-printing/), also known as additive manufacturing, is a technology that constructs objects layer by layer using powdered metals, plastics, or other bondable materials based on digital model files. Different from traditional subtractive manufacturing (such as cutting and machining), 3D printing creates objects from scratch. According to the designed 3D model, materials are gradually stacked to form a solid, which can greatly reduce material waste and can produce complex structures that are difficult to achieve with traditional processes.

## Practice Exercises

### 3D Scanning
1. Prepare the 3D scanner and ensure that the device is calibrated and has sufficient power.
2. Place the object to be scanned on a stable surface, ensuring uniform lighting around and no obvious reflections.
3. Start the 3D scanner. Follow the operation instructions of the software provided with the device, slowly move the scanner around the object, and collect data from different angles to ensure that all sides of the object are scanned.
4. After scanning, perform preliminary processing on the scanned data in the software, such as removing noise, filling holes, etc., generate a complete 3D model file, and save it in a common format, such as STL format.

### Modeling with the Vase Generator Model on the Makerworld Website and Importing it into the Bambustudio Software for Printing
1. Open the browser and go to the [makerworld](https://makerworld.com/) website.
2. Find "vase generator" in the "MakerLab" which is on the top bar of the website and use the corresponding model generation tool.
3. According to the parameter setting options provided by the generator, such as the height, diameter, and shape details of the vase (such as whether there are patterns, the style of the bottle neck, etc.), adjust to get a satisfactory vase design.

4. Click the generate model button to generate the 3D model of the vase and download it as a 3MF or STL format file.

6. Adjust the position, scale, and other pre - printing settings of the model in the software to ensure that the position of the model on the printing platform is appropriate and the size meets expectations.

7. Set the printing parameters, such as printing speed, temperature, layer height, infill rate, etc. After completion, click the print button, connect the printer, and start printing the vase.

   Due to time constraints, when adjusting the model's position and scale in Bambustudio, we didn't manage to complete the printing process for this particular model.
